And this success stimulates the proliferation of many benchmark deep neural models. Before practitioners develop models for the task of interest, they can actually have access to some off-the-shelf models, which are already trained on the same, similar or even totally different tasks. Those pretrained models are usually dedicated to mine the training data well, and the informative knowledge is supposed to exist in the learned representations or the model weights themselves. In this sense, how to mine the knowledge in the pretrained models is also of significance in achieving more promising performance.\n          </p>\n\n          <p className=\"contentText\">\n            There are multiple ways to fulfill the model mining. For example, inspired by the human education, we can leverage the pretrained models as privileged information or additional resources following the teacher-student paradigm. Then the knowledge can be manifested and distilled on the learned logits or intermediate features, such as attention maps, similarity among examples, and local graphs. As a result, the student models are expected to perform better with the help of the mined knowledge in teacher models. Likewise, pretrained models can also serve as a general yet powerful platform for adapting customized models for different target tasks. For example, large-scale pretrained models with huge parameters as BERT, GPT-3, and ViT show great generalization ability in many downstream tasks, and we can have decent performance for the target task with only limited data.\n          </p>\n\n          <div style={{ height: 20 }}/>\n\n          <h2>Topics of Interest</h2>\n          <p className=\"contentText\">\n              The TOPIC model mining of this workshop aims to investigate more diverse and advanced manners in mining knowledge within models, which tends to leverage the pretrained models more wisely, elegantly and systematically.
