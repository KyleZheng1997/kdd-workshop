witnessed the prosperity of deep learning in a variety of applications, such as computer vision, natural language processing and speech recognition and enhancement. And this success stimulates the proliferation of many benchmark deep neural models. Before practitioners develop models for the task of interest, they can actually have access to some off-the-shelf models, which are already trained on the same, similar or even totally different tasks. Those pretrained models are usually dedicated to mine the training data well, and the informative knowledge is supposed to exist in the learned representations or the model weights themselves. In this sense, how to mine the knowledge in the pretrained models is also of significance in achieving more promising performance.\n          </p>\n\n          <p className=\"contentText\">\n            There are multiple ways to fulfill the model mining. For example, inspired by the human education, we can leverage the pretrained models as privileged information or additional resources following the teacher-student paradigm. Then the knowledge can be manifested and distilled on the learned logits or intermediate features, such as attention maps, similarity among examples, and local graphs. As a result, the student models are expected to perform better with the help of the mined knowledge in teacher models. Likewise, pretrained models can also serve as a general yet powerful platform for adapting customized models for different target tasks. For example, large-scale pretrained models with huge parameters as BERT, GPT-3, and ViT show great generalization ability in many downstream tasks, and we can have decent performance for the target task with only limited data.\n          </p>\n\n          <div style={{ height: 20 }}/>\n\n          <h2>Topics of Interest</h2>\n          <p className=\"contentText\">\n              The TOPIC model mining of this workshop aims to investigate more diverse and advanced manners in mining knowledge within models, which tends to leverage the pretrained models more wisely, elegantly and systematically.

I will present Knowledge-adaptation priors (K-priors) to reduce the cost of retraining by enabling quick and accurate adaptation for a wide-variety of tasks and models. This is made possible by a combination of weight and function-space priors to reconstruct the gradients of the past, which recovers and generalizes many existing, but seemingly-unrelated, adaptation strategies. Overall, my hope is to convince the audience that K-priors provide an intuitive yet practical mechanism for generic adaptation in machine learning. <br />\n                <b> Speaker Profile </b>: <a href=\"https://emtiyaz.github.io/\"> <b>Emtiyaz Khan</b> </a> (also known as Emti) is a team leader at the RIKEN center for Advanced Intelligence Project (AIP) in Tokyo where he leads the Approximate Bayesian Inference Team. He is also a visiting professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology (TUAT).

The main goal of Emti’s research is to understand the principles of learning from data and use them to develop algorithms that can learn like living beings. For the past 10 years, his work has focused on developing Bayesian methods that could lead to such fundamental principles. The approximate Bayesian inference team now continues to use these principles, as well as derive new ones, to solve real-world problems.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n\n            <br />\n\n            <div className=\"speakersText\">\n              <p>\n                <b> Title </b>:  Towards Better Utilization of Pre-trained Models <br />\n                <b> Abstract </b>:  Pre-training, which first pretrains a large model on a large amount of unlabeled data and then fine-tunes the pre-trained model on downstream tasks, has become a domain paradigm in multiple AI fields, especially natural language  processing (NLP). In this talk, I will focus on better utilization of pre-trained models and ask two fundamental questions:\n                <ol style={{ marginBottom: \"0px\" }}>\n                  <li> Is fine-tuning universally applicable to all downstream tasks? </li>\n                  <li> How to efficiently utilize pretrained models considering diverse requirements of model size and latency in different downstream tasks? </li>\n                </ol>\n                  For the first question, I will show that direct fine-tuning does not work very well for an important NLP task: machine translation, and propose to fuse the pre-trained model with standard encoder-decoder framework, which can better leverage pre-trained models. <br />\n                  For the second question, I will introduce our recent work, BERT-NAS, which leverages neural architecture search (NAS) to find lightweight models that achieve better accuracy than previous approaches and can be directly applied to different downstream tasks with adaptive model sizes for different requirements of memory or latency. \n                <br />\n                <b> Speaker Profile </b>: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/\"> <b>Dr. Tao Qin</b> </a> is a Senior Principal Researcher and managing the Deep and Reinforcement Learning group at Microsoft Research Asia.
